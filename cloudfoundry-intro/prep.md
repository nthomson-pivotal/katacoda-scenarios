We are going to deploy a sample Java application to our CF space, but first we need to build it.

The sample application has been cloned to the `spring-music` directory, enter that directory using `cd spring-music`{{execute}}.

You can now build the application using Gradle, like so: `./gradlew assemble`{{execute}}.
