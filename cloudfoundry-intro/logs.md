You can view logs for applications deployed on CloudFoundry using the `cf logs` command. These logs include:

- Application output (via StdOut)
- HTTP access logs
- Operations such as staging, restarting, scaling

View snapshot of the logs of the application we deployed by running the command `cf logs spring-music --recent`{{execute}}.

You can also tail the logs by reducing the command down to `cf logs spring-music`{{execute}} (exit using Control-C).
